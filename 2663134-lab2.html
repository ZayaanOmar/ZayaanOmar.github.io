            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                My name is Muhammed Zayaan Omar, but most people just call me Zayaan or Bill. I am currently busy with my third year of studies in Computer Science at Wits.  I'm quite interested in everything to do with computers, hence the reason I am studying Computer Science.

            <h3>Latest Project</h3>
            <p>
                The most recent project I have worked on was a second year project for the course Mobile Computing. We had to develop an app that would allow users to speak to mental health counsellors anonymously. They had to be able to sign up, choose what kind of problems they would like help with, and would then be matched with an appropriate counsellor.
